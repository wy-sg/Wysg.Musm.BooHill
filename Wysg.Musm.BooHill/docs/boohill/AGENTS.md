BooHill UI updates:
- "new" status label visibility now uses a boolean flag so the text renders whenever the recency rule is satisfied.
- Main list header columns now align with row data, with price range between office and status.
- Main list rows now stretch to the full header width for consistent column alignment.
- Main list includes an "거래 완료" toggle column bound to the sold flag.
- Bulk import window list sections use fixed row heights with auto vertical scrollbars.
- Duplicate house entries in bulk import now show the matched house_id when available.
- Price, value, and price range displays now use thousand separators.
